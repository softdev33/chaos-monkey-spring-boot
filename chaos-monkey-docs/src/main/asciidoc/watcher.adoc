[[watcher]]
== Watcher ==
A watcher is a Chaos Monkey for Spring Boot component, that will scan your app for a specific type of annotation.

Following Spring annotation are supported:

- @Controller
- @RestController
- @Service
- @Repository
- @Component

With the help of https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-api[Spring AOP], Chaos Monkey recognizes the
execution of a _public_ method and will either not execute any action or start one of its assaults. You can customize the behave by
<<configuration,configuration>>.

=== Customize Watcher
You can customize the behavior of all watchers using the property *watchedCustomServices* and decide which classes and public methods
should be attacked. If no signatures are stored, all classes and public methods, recognized by the watchers are attacked by default.

You can either maintain the list in your application properties or adjust it at runtime using the Spring Boot Actuator Endpoint.
